#### 2.1 Building a personal website [wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/) 

__Step 1 - register__

__Step 2 - pick a domain__

- you can change this later (but good domain names are hard to come by)
- (from [Personal website building for dummies](https://www.leiliu.net/Skillz-Hour/))
    - domains using one's name is (I think) a common practice, but see [here](http://www.phonologist.org/) :)
    - try to avoid stuff like [bigsyntax.guru](https://www.godaddy.com/dpp/find?checkAvail=1&tmskey=&domainToCheck=bigsyntax.guru)
