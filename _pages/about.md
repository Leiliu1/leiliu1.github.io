I am a PhD candidate interested in Syntax, Computational Linguistics and Chinese dialects. My interests lie in the freedom of word orders. Finished projects on word order include Mandarin SOV derivation and Minimalist parsing of English heavy NP shift (HNPS). Currently, I am working on my thesis under the working title "Phrasal Weight Effect On Word Order".
