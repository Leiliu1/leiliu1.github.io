__Step 2 - pick a domain__

<img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/04/05/yoTRISYKzfWs41i.jpg" width="500"/>

- you can change this later (but good domain names are hard to come up with)
- (from [Personal website building for dummies](https://www.leiliu.net/Skillz-Hour/))
    - domains using one's name is (I think) a common practice, but see [here](http://www.phonologist.org/) :)
    - try to avoid stuff like [bigsyntax.guru](https://www.godaddy.com/dpp/find?checkAvail=1&tmskey=&domainToCheck=bigsyntax.guru)

__Step 3 - basic setup__

- _design_, _fonts_, _features_, which can be changed later
