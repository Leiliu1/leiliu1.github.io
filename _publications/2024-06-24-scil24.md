	abstract = {&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This paper shows that a left-corner parser for minimalist grammars requires more memory resources to parse center-embedding structures than both left- and right-embedding ones. In doing so, we propose a complexity metric that is derived from the notion of tenure. The results, if on the right track, indicate the viability of left-corner parsing for MGs as a model for human sentence processing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},
